			<h1><strong>Null Studio User Agreement</strong></h1>
			<p>These Terms of Use were last modified on July 31, 2022.<br />
				<br />
				These Terms of Use (&quot;Agreement&quot;) apply to you and Null Studio (&quot;we&quot;,
				&quot;our&quot; or &quot;us&quot;) regarding your use of our website (the &quot;Site&quot;), our various
				apps, games and social networks (the &quot;Apps&quot;), and the offering of certain other features,
				content, or contests from time to time (collectively, &quot;Additional Features&quot;) (the Site, Apps,
				and Additional Features shall hereinafter sometimes be collectively referred to as the
				&quot;Services&quot;).&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				These Terms of Use include our policy for acceptable use of the Services and govern your rights,
				obligations and restrictions regarding your use of the Services. You are only authorised to use the
				Services if you agree to abide by all applicable laws and this Agreement. By using the Services, you
				agree to be bound by this Agreement.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				Because your privacy is important to us, this Agreement also incorporates, by this reference, our
				<a href="privacy_en.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which explains how we collect and
				use your content and information. Please read the <a href="privacy_en.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
			</p>

			<p>Your access and use of the Services constitutes your representation and warranty that you are of legal
				age to form a binding contract, and if not of legal age, that you access and use the Services with the
				permission of a parent or legal guardian, and that you are not a person barred from using or receiving
				the Services by any local, state, federal or international law.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				In order to participate in certain Services, you may be notified that you are required to agree to
				additional terms and conditions, and such additional terms are hereby incorporated into this Agreement
				by this reference, but such additional terms and conditions shall control solely for the applicable
				Service.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				We may modify this Agreement from time to time and such modifications shall be effective upon posting on
				the Services. You will be deemed to have agreed to any such modifications by your further use of the
				Services after any such modification is posted. It is therefore important that you review this Agreement
				regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. If you do not agree with the modifications,
				please discontinue use of the Services immediately.&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>I. YOUR ACCOUNT / PASSWORD SECURITY / SUSPENSION, TERMINATION</strong>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>When you access the Apps for the first time, you may be asked to indicate your age. Please consider we
				need it to tailor your experience in-game. We may therefore apply some age restrictions to our Apps and
				you agree and acknowledge that some of our Apps require you to be thirteen (13) years of age and above.
			</p>

			<p>In order to benefit from&nbsp;some features of the Services, you may be required to register an account
				(an &quot;Account&quot;). When creating or updating an Account, you are required to provide us with
				certain personal information, which may include your name, birthdate, e-mail address, and, in some
				cases, payment information. This information will be held and used in accordance with our <a href="privacy_en.html">Privacy Policy</a>.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				You may never use another&#39;s Account without permission. You may not create more than
								one Account. You are prohibited from registering a new Account if you have previously
								had an Account terminated.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				You are responsible for (i) keeping confidential any password that you created to use any aspect of the
				Services requiring registration, and (ii) restricting access to your computer, console, or mobile
				device. You agree to accept full responsibility for all activities that occur within your Account. You
				must notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorised use of your Account.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				Although we will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorised use of your Account, whether
				with or without your knowledge, you may be liable for our losses or the losses of our third-party
				licensors, content providers, merchants, advertisers, sponsors, and service providers (collectively,
				&quot;Our Providers&quot;) due to such unauthorised use.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				Without limiting anything in this Agreement, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to restrict,
				suspend, or terminate your Account and/or your access to any or all parts of the Services at any time,
				for any or no reason, with or without prior notice, and without liability, including in the event we
				stop offering any aspect of the Services. We expressly reserve the right to restrict, suspend and/or
				terminate your access to any part of the Services if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have
				violated any of the terms of this Agreement.&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p><strong>II. PURCHASES / PAYMENTS / REFUNDS</strong>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>We may charge fees associated with certain Services, including, without limitation, for subscriptions,
				the download of Apps, and the purchase of Virtual Items (as defined below). Such products or services
				may be made available for purchase on specified pages of the Site, within the Apps,&nbsp;on Our
				Providers&rsquo; websites or platforms (including third-party marketplaces),&nbsp;or otherwise as
				indicated through the Services.<br />
				<br />
				The price of any product or service purchased through the Services will be the price specified at the
				time of your purchase. Prices for all products and services exclude all applicable taxes and
				telecommunication charges, unless otherwise indicated. To the extent permissible by law, you agree to be
				responsible for any such applicable taxes and telecommunication charges.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				Your purchase of any App, Virtual Item or other content constitutes your representation and warranty
				that you are of legal age to form a binding contract, and if not of legal age, that you have placed such
				order with the permission of a parent or legal guardian, and that you are not a person barred from using
				or receiving the Services by any local, state, federal or international law.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				If you provide credit card information to us, you represent that you are the authorised user of the
				credit card that is used to pay the subscription or other fees. If you order a subscription, each month
				that you use the Services, you agree and reaffirm that we are authorised to charge your credit card for
				the subscription fee. You agree to promptly notify us of any changes to your credit card account number,
				its expiration date and/or your billing address, and you agree to promptly notify us if your credit card
				expires or is cancelled for any reason. You will have ten business days to accept any new fees. In the
				event that you fail to accept the new fees by written notice to us, your subscription, plan, or other
				ongoing, paid-for Service, as applicable, may be immediately terminated. We reserve the right to collect
				applicable taxes and impose premium surcharges for certain Services.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				Apps, Additional Features and Virtual Items can be downloaded in connection with the Services for a
				charge. We assume no liability for purchaser error, trial versions, software purchased for the wrong
				telephone, device or platform, promotion codes or discounts not provided at the time of purchase, or any
				purchased item 90 days after the purchase date for any reason (&quot;Purchaser Errors&quot;). We will
				not be liable for any errors on billing statements issued to you by your carrier&nbsp;or Our
				Providers&rsquo; websites or platforms (including third-party marketplaces). You accept full
				responsibility for confirming that the phone or other device manufacturer, phone or other device model,
				and carrier are supported and that the phone or other device is compatible to the products or services
				purchased, downloaded or otherwise obtained by you through the Services. Although we will make
				commercially reasonable efforts to help you obtain the proper software for your telephone, device or
				platform, we will not be liable or responsible for any Purchaser Errors. If you have other questions in
				connection with any product or service available through the Services, please contact us at support@nullstudio.cn. In no event will we be liable for any defects or other problems
				associated with downloads or purchases through the Services after a period of ninety (90) calendar days
				has expired from the date of such download or purchase, as applicable. Please read the system
				requirements very carefully before making any purchases.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				Right of cancellation: If you choose to cancel your order, you may do so within 14 days from when you
				received your receipt without giving any reason. To cancel your order, you must inform us of your
				decision via a declaration by mentioning the reference of the purchase, the date of the purchase, your
				name and your address, sent to the following address:&nbsp;support@nullstudio.cn. To meet the
				cancellation deadline, you must send your communication of cancellation before the 14-day period has
				expired.&nbsp;If you choose to cancel your monthly subscription, you may do so pursuant to the terms.
			</p>

			<p>Effects of cancellation: We will reimburse you no later than 14 days from the day on which we receive
				your cancellation notice. We will use the same means of payment as you used for the transaction, and you
				will not incur any fees for such reimbursement.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Exception to the right of cancellation: You cannot cancel your order for the supply of digital content if
				the delivery has started upon your request and acknowledgement that you thereby lose your cancellation
				right.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				CERTAIN APPS ALLOW YOU TO PURCHASE VIRTUAL ITEMS (AS DEFINED BELOW) WITHIN THE APP. SUCH PURCHASES MAY
				BE MADE AVAILABLE IN BOTH APPS WHICH YOU MUST PURCHASE TO DOWNLOAD AS WELL AS APPS WHICH ARE FREE TO
				DOWNLOAD. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN APPS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE FREE TO DOWNLOAD, MAY CONTAIN THIRD-PARTY
				ADVERTISEMENTS THAT MAY REDIRECT YOU TO A THIRD-PARTY SITE.&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p><strong>III. VIRTUAL ITEMS</strong>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Certain Services may allow you to &quot;earn&quot; or &quot;purchase&quot; (a) virtual currency,
				including but not limited to virtual coins, cash, tokens, or points, all for use in the Services; (b)
				virtual in-game items (together with virtual currency); or (c) certain in-game benefits (&quot;Virtual
				Items&quot;). Virtual Items have no real-world value and cannot be redeemed for actual currency, goods
				or other items of monetary value, including in the event that you have unused Virtual Items remaining in
				your account at the time your account is closed, whether such closure was voluntary or not. All sales of
				Virtual Items are final. No refunds will be given, except in our sole and absolute
				discretion.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				The purchase of any Virtual Item is merely the purchase of a license to use the Virtual Item in the
				applicable Services and does not transfer ownership of that Virtual Item to you. This licence is
				personal to you and cannot be sold, transferred, assigned, gifted, traded or sublicensed. Accordingly,
				we expressly prohibit and do not recognize any purported sales, transfers, assignments, gifts, trades or
				sublicences of Virtual Items, whether for &quot;real money,&quot; goods or any other exchange outside of
				the Services. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and may subject you to a
				termination of your account, a lifetime ban from our products and services, and even legal action.&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p><strong>IV. ONLINE CONDUCT&nbsp;</strong></p>

			<p>You, as a user, agree to use the Services only for lawful purposes. Specific prohibited activities
				include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;<br />

				other content contravening good moral standards;&nbsp;<br />

				16. access or use of a third-party account or any Virtual Items that have been sublicensed, rented,
				leased, sold, traded, gifted, bequeathed, or otherwise transferred from the holder or the original
				account creator;<br />
				17. using multiple accounts, manual procedures, bots, scripts or other processes in order to accumulate

				activities. Any conduct by you in violation of the foregoing prohibitions may result in the suspension
				or termination of your Account and your access to the Services.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>V. CONTENT&nbsp;</strong></p>

			<p><strong>A. Proprietary Rights</strong>&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				With the exception of content posted by users of the Services (&quot;User Content&quot;), all materials
				contained on the Services, including all content, the Virtual Items and the software, graphics, text and
				look and feel of the sites, and all trademarks (including Null Studio&reg; and the titles of all of our
				Apps), copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights related thereto (&quot;Proprietary
				Materials&quot;), are owned or controlled by us, our subsidiaries or affiliated companies, our
				third-party licensors, and/or our advertising partners. You may not modify, remove, delete, augment, add
				to, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, create derivative works from, or in any
				way exploit any Proprietary Materials, or any other protectable aspects of the Services, in whole or in
				part. Subject to your compliance with this Agreement and any other relevant policies related to the
				Services, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable limited licence subject to the
				limitations herein to access and use the Services and Proprietary Materials for your own non-commercial
				entertainment purposes consistent with the intended purpose of the Services. You agree not to use the
				Service for any other purpose.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				As referenced above, even though you may buy Virtual Items with &quot;real-world&quot; money, you do
				not, in fact, &quot;own&quot; such items. By making such a purchase, you are merely being granted a
				licence to use such Virtual Items in the applicable Apps or other Services for which such Virtual Items
				can be used. The Virtual Items have no real-world value and are not in any way a credit or balance of
				real currency or its equivalent. In no event can any Virtual Items be redeemed for actual,
				&quot;real-world&quot; currency. We have the sole and absolute right to manage, regulate, control,
				modify and/or eliminate such Virtual Items as we see fit in our sole discretion, and shall have no
				liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				<strong>B. Distribution/Uploading of Content</strong>&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				You are prohibited from posting on or transmitting through the Services (e.g., through uploaded content,
				a chat or user forum, online review or comment posted through the Services) any content that infringes
				upon a third party&rsquo;s intellectual property rights or is defamatory, damaging, illegal, or
				offensive.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				Without limiting the foregoing, you may not post, modify, distribute, or reproduce in any way on the
				Services any copyrighted material, trademarks, or other proprietary information belonging to others
				unless you have first obtained the prior written consent of the owner of such proprietary rights. It is
				our policy to terminate the account of anyone who repeatedly infringes the copyright rights of others
				upon our receipt of proper notification from the copyright owner or the copyright owner&rsquo;s legal
				agent.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				By submitting content or materials (&quot;Your Content&quot;) to us through the Services, including,
				without limitation, uploading any materials, choosing a username, or participation in any chats or
				forums, you automatically grant us, or warrant that the owner of such content has expressly granted us,
				the royalty-free, irrevocable, sublicensable and transferable, non-exclusive right and licence to use,
				reproduce, publish, translate, prepare derivative works of, copy, perform and distribute Your Content,
				including all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to such
				content, and your username, actual name, and likeness (if submitted), in whole or in part worldwide,
				including in connection with announcing you as the winner of a sweepstakes/contest or including you in
				leaderboards. You also hereby grant each user of the Services a non-exclusive licence to access Your
				Content through the Services, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform Your Content as
				permitted through the functionality of the Services and under this Agreement. The above licences granted
				by you in Your Content are perpetual and will only terminate if you&#39;ve requested the removal or
				deletion of Your Content from the Services (such licence will terminate within a commercially reasonable
				time after your request to remove or delete Your Content). You understand and agree, however, that we
				may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of Your Content that have been
				removed or deleted. The foregoing is subject to the provision regarding Unsolicited Submissions
				below.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				Subject to these grants, you retain any and all rights which may exist in Your Content.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				We may disclose any of Your Content or electronic communication of any kind (i) to satisfy any law,
				regulation, or government request; (ii) if such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate our
				Services; (iii) to protect the rights or property of us and our officers, directors, employees
				and agents; or (iv) to protect Our Providers and any other user.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				<strong>C. Advertising&nbsp;</strong><br />
				<br />
				By using our Site/Apps, you may be offered advertising content. As such, you warrant that you agree with
				our <a href="privacy_en.html">Privacy Policy</a> in relation to advertising.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				We are not responsible for the third-party products or services displayed therein.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				<strong>D. Representations and Warranties</strong>&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary licences, rights, consents, and permissions
				to use and authorise us to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary
				rights in and to any and all of Your Content and to enable inclusion and use of Your Content in the
				manner contemplated by the Services and this Agreement. You further represent and warrant Your Content
				will not defame any third party and that the use of Your Content on the Services will not violate or
				infringe upon the intellectual property rights, or the rights of privacy or publicity, of any third
				party.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				<strong>E. Third-Party Content &amp; User Content</strong>&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				You acknowledge that we provide online services that may post content supplied by third
				parties and users. We have no more editorial control over the content posted by such third parties
				(including User Content) than does a public library or newsstand. Any opinions, advice, statements,
				judgments, services, offers, or other information that constitutes part of the content expressed or made
				available by third parties, including User Content, are those of the respective authors or distributors
				and not of us or our affiliates or any of our officers, directors, employees, or agents.
				While we retain the right to filter or reject User Content and other content posted by third parties, we
				review User Content and other third-party content in a limited gate-keeper fashion and have no
				obligation to investigate whether any User Content and other third-party content violate any term of
				this Agreement and will not do so in most cases. We neither endorse nor are responsible for the User
				Content or any other content posted to the Services by anyone other than us&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				Just as you retain complete ownership of Your Content (subject to the licence to us granted above), all
				other users of the Services retain ownership of their User Content. You may not modify, remove, delete,
				augment, add to, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, create derivative works
				from, or in any way exploit any User Content in whole or in part.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				<strong>F. Unsolicited Submissions</strong>&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				We are pleased to hear from our customers and welcome their comments regarding our Services.
				Unfortunately, however, long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider creative
				ideas, suggestions or materials other than those it has specifically requested. We hope you will
				understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings
				when projects developed by our professional staff might seem to others to be similar to their own
				creative work. Accordingly, we must, regretfully, ask that you do not send us any original creative
				materials such as game ideas or original artwork. While we do value your feedback on our services and
				products, we request that you be specific in your comments on those services and products, and not
				submit any creative ideas, suggestions or materials. If, despite our request that you not send us any
				other creative materials, you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts or other
				information (collectively, the &quot;Unsolicited Submissions&quot;), the Unsolicited Submissions shall
				be deemed, and shall remain, the property of us. None of the Unsolicited Submissions shall be
				subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of us, and we shall not be liable for any use
				or disclosure of any Unsolicited Submissions. Without limitation of the foregoing, we shall exclusively
				own all now known or hereafter existing rights to the Unsolicited Submissions of every kind and nature,
				in perpetuity, throughout the universe and shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Unsolicited
				Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of
				the Unsolicited Submissions. You waive any and all moral rights in any such Unsolicited Submissions as
				well as any claim to a right of credit or approval. The foregoing shall also apply to any creative
				submissions you make at our specific request, unless otherwise agreed in writing.&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p><strong>G. Non-fungible Tokens</strong>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Only limited personal, non-commercial use of, and resale rights of Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) are granted
				and you have no right to license, commercially exploit, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works,
				publicly perform, or publicly display an NFT, or the music or the artwork therein. You have no right to
				modify and/or use the art to market or sell any products. All copyrights and other rights are reserved
				and not granted.<br />
				<br />
				We are not responsible for the blockchain network and/or any other third-party service that you
				might access or use for the purpose of using, owning, or transferring the Non-fungible Tokens, and you
				warrant that you will hold us harmless from any and all claims of any nature that in any way arise
				from your use of any third-party service and/or platform.<br />
				<br />
				In the case of resale of the NFT according to the conditions authorized above, no transfer of rights
				whatsoever will be granted, and the new owner will be subject to the same limitations.
			</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>VI. NOTICE OF INFRINGEMENT</strong>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Without limiting the foregoing, if you believe that any content, including User Content, or other
				materials, posted on the Services constitutes an infringement of your copyrights or trademarks, we will
				respond promptly to any properly submitted notice containing the information detailed below. Please send
				all notices to the following e-mail address:&nbsp;support@nullstudio.cn.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				To be effective, the notification must be a written communication that includes the following: 1. A
				physical or electronic signature of a person authorised to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive
				right that is allegedly infringed; 2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been
				infringed, or if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single
				notification, a representative list of such works at that site; 3. Identification of the material that
				is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or
				access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the
				material; 4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an
				address, telephone number, and if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party
				may be contacted; 5. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the
				material in the manner complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
				and 6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury,
				that the complaining party is authorised to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is
				allegedly infringed.&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p><strong>VII. NON-COMMERCIAL USE</strong>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>The Services are for your personal use only and may not be used in connection with any commercial
				endeavours except those that are specifically endorsed or approved by us. Any use of the Services in
				violation of this provision, including communicating any advertisement or solicitation, or collecting
				usernames and/or email addresses of account holders by electronic or other means for the purpose of
				sending unsolicited email or unauthorised framing of or linking to the Services, is prohibited.&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p><strong>VIII. ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS</strong>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>When you use the Services or send emails to us, you are communicating with us electronically. You consent
				to receive communications from us electronically. We will communicate with you by email or by posting

				we provide you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in
				writing.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>IX. LINKS</strong>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>The Services may contain links to websites operated by third parties, including through in-App
				advertisements. We do not monitor or control the linked sites and make no representations regarding, and
				are not liable or responsible for the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, reliability or availability
				of, any of the content uploaded, displayed, or distributed, or products, or services available at these
				sites. If you choose to access any third-party site, you do so at your own risk. The presence of a link
				to a third-party site does not constitute or imply our endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation of
				the third party or of the content, products, or services contained on, or available through, the
				third-party site.&nbsp;<br />
				<br />
				We reserve the right to disable links from or to third-party sites.&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p><strong>X. THIRD-PARTY MERCHANTS / PROVIDERS</strong>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>The Services may enable you to order and receive products, information and services from businesses that
				are not owned or operated by us. The purchase, payment, warranty, guarantee, delivery, maintenance, and
				all other matters concerning the merchandise, services or information, opinion or advice ordered or
				received from such businesses are solely between you and such businesses. We do not endorse, warrant, or
				guarantee such products, information, or services, and are not liable for the accuracy, completeness, or
				usefulness of such information or the quality or availability of such products or services. We will not
				be a party to or in any way be responsible for monitoring any transaction between you and third-party
				providers of such products, services, or information, or for ensuring the confidentiality of your credit
				card information. Any separate charges or obligations you incur in your dealings with these third
