			<h2>Null Studio Privacy Policy</h2>
			Null Studio respects the privacy of customers of its products and services and complies
			with applicable laws for the protection of your privacy, including, without limitation, the California
			Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), the European Union General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), the UK GDPR,
			and the Swiss and EU Privacy Shield Frameworks. <br />
			<br />

			<b>1. Definitions</b><br />
			<br />

			Wherever we talk about Personal Data below, we mean any information that can either itself identify you as
			an individual ("Personally Identifying Information") or that can be connected to you indirectly by linking
			it to Personally Identifying Information. We also processes anonymous data, aggregated or not, to analyze
			and produce statistics related to the habits, usage patterns, and demographics of customers as a group or as
			individuals. Such anonymous data does not allow the identification of the customers to which it relates.
			We may share anonymous data, aggregated or not, with third parties.<br />
			<br />

			Other capitalized terms in this Privacy Policy shall have the meanings defined in the <a
				href="agreement_en.html">Null Studio User Agreement</a> ("NSUA").
			<br />
			<br />

			<b>2. Why We Collects and Processes Data</b><br />
			<br />

			We collects and processes Personal Data for the following reasons:<br />
			<br />

			a) where it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with you to provide a full-featured gaming
			service and deliver associated Content and Services;<br />
			b) where it is necessary for compliance with legal obligations that we are subject to (e.g. our obligations
			to keep certain information under tax laws);<br />
			c) where it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate and legal interests of us or a third party
			(e.g. the interests of our other customers), except where such interests are overridden by your prevailing
			legitimate interests and rights; or<br />
			d) where you have given consent to it. <br />
			<br />

			These reasons for collecting and processing Personal Data determine and limit what Personal Data we collect
			and how we use it (section 3. below), how long we store it (section 4. below), who has access to it (section
			5. below) and what rights and other control mechanisms are available to you as a user (section 6.
			below).<br />
			<br />

			<b>3. The Types and Sources of Data We Collect</b><br />
			<br />

			3.1 Basic Account Data(Any Exists)<br />

			When setting up an Account, we will collect your email address and country of residence. You are also
			required to choose a user name and a password. The provision of this information is necessary to register a
			User Account of our products and services. <br />
			We do not require you to provide or use your real name for the setup of a User Account.<br />
			<br />

			3.2 Transaction and Payment Data<br />

			In order to make a transaction with us (e.g. to purchase Subscriptions for Content and Services), you may
			need to provide payment data to us to enable the transaction. If you pay by
			credit card, you need to provide typical credit card information (name, address, credit card number,
			expiration date and security code) to us, which we will process and transmit to the payment service
			provider of your choice to enable the transaction and perform anti-fraud checks. Likewise, we will
			receive data from your payment service provider for the same reasons. <br />
			<br />

			3.3 Other Data You Explicitly Submit<br />

			We will collect and process Personal Data whenever you explicitly provide it to us or send it as part of
			communication with others through our products and services, e.g. forums, chats, or when you provide feedback or
			other user generated content. This data includes:
			<ul>
				<li>Information that you post, comment or follow in any of our Content and Services;</li>
				<li>Information sent through chat;</li>
				<li>Information you provide when you request information or support from us or purchase Content and
					Services from us, including information necessary to process your orders with the relevant payment
					merchant or, in case of physical goods, shipping providers;</li>
				<li>Information you provide to us when participating in competitions, contests and tournaments or
					responding to surveys, e.g. your contact details.</li>
			</ul>

			3.4 Your Use of the Content and Services<br />

			We collect a variety of information through your general interaction with the websites, Content and Services
			offered by us. Personal Data we collect may include, but is not limited to, browser and device
			information, data collected through automated electronic interactions and application usage data.<br />
			Likewise, we will track your process across our websites and applications to verify that you are not a bot
			and to optimize our services. <br />
			<br />

			3.5 Your Use of Games and other Subscriptions<br />

			In order to provide you with services, we need to collect, store and use various information about your
			activity in our Content and Services. "Content-Related Information" includes your User Account, as well as what
			is usually referred to as "game statistics". By game statistics we mean information about your games'
			preferences, progress in the games, playtime, as well as information about the device you are using,
			including what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data.
			<br />
			<br />

			3.6 Tracking Data and Cookies<br />

			We may use "Cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, and similar
			technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixels, ad tags and device identifiers) to
			help us analyze how users use our services, as well as to improve the
			services we are offering, to improve marketing, analytics or website
			functionality. The use of Cookies is standard on the internet. Although most
			web browsers automatically accept cookies, the decision of whether to accept
			or not is yours. You may adjust your browser settings to prevent the
			reception of cookies, or to provide notification whenever a cookie is sent
			to you. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate
			settings on your browser.
			However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to access the
			full functionality of our websites.<br />
			When you visit any of our services, our servers log your IP address, which
			is a number that is automatically assigned to the network your computer is
			part of.<br />
			<br />

			3.7 Content Recommendations<br />

			We may process information collected under this section 3 so that our content, products and services can be
			tailored to meet your needs and populated with relevant recommendations and offers. This is done to improve
			your customer experience. <br />
			Subject to your separate consent or where explicitly permitted under applicable laws on email marketing,
			we may send you marketing messages about products and services offered by us to your email address. In
			such a case we may also use your collected information to customize such marketing messages as well as
			collect information on whether you opened such messages and which links in their text you followed. <br />
			<u>You can opt out or withdraw your consent to receive marketing emails at any time by either withdrawing
				the consent on the same page where you previously provided it or clicking the "unsubscribe" link
				provided in every marketing email.</u> <br />
			<br />

			3.8 Information Required to Detect Violations<br />

			We collect certain data that is required for our detection, investigation and prevention of fraud, cheating
			and other violations of the NSUA and applicable laws ("Violations"). This data is used only for the purposes
			of detection, investigation, prevention and, where applicable, acting on of such Violations and stored only
			for the minimum amount of time needed for this purpose. If the data indicates that a Violation has occurred,
			we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims during the
			applicable statute of limitations or until a legal case related to it has been resolved. Please note that
			the specific data stored for this purpose may not be disclosed to you if the disclosure will compromise the
			mechanism through which we detect, investigate and prevent such Violations. <br />
			<br />

			<b>4. How Long We Store Data</b><br />
			<br />

			We will only store your information as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information is
			collected and processed or &mdash; where the applicable law provides for longer storage and retention period
			&mdash; for the storage and retention period required by law. After that your Personal Data will be deleted,
			blocked or anonymized, as provided by applicable law.<br />
			<br />

			In particular:<br />
			<ul>
				<li>If you terminate your User Account, your Personal Data will be marked for deletion except to
					the degree legal requirements or other prevailing legitimate purposes dictate a longer storage.
				</li>
				<li>In certain cases, Personal Data cannot be completely deleted in order to ensure the consistency of
					the gameplay experience. For instance, matches you have played that
					affect other players' matchmaking data and scores will not be deleted; rather, your connection to
					these matches will be permanently anonymized. </li>
				<li>Please note that we are required to retain certain transactional data under statutory commercial
					and tax law for a period of up to ten (10) years.</li>
				<li>If you withdraw your consent on which a processing of your Personal Data or of the Personal Data of
					your child is based, we will delete your Personal Data or respectively the Personal Data of your
					child without undue delay to the extent that the collection and processing of the Personal Data was
					based on the withdrawn consent.</li>
				<li>If you exercise a right to object to the processing of your Personal Data, we will review your
					objection and delete your Personal Data that we processed for the purpose to which you objected
					without undue delay, unless another legal basis for processing and retaining this data exists or
					unless applicable law requires us to retain the data.</li>
			</ul>
			<br />

			<b>5. Who Has Access to Data</b><br />
			<br />

			We do not sell Personal Data. However, we may share or provide access to each of the categories of
			Personal Data we collect as necessary for the following business purposes.<br />
			<br />

			5.1 We and out subsidiaries may share your Personal Data with each other and use it to the degree
			necessary to achieve the purposes listed in section 2 above. In the event of a reorganization, sale or
			merger we may transfer Personal Data to the relevant third party subject to applicable laws.<br />
			<br />

			5.2 We may also share your Personal Data with our third party service providers that provide customer
			support services in connection with goods, Content and Services distributed via us. Your Personal Data
			will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy and only as far as this is necessary for performing
			customer support services. Check here: <a href="privacy_3rd_en.html">Null Studio Third Party Information Sharing Checklist</a>.<br />
			<br />

			5.3 In accordance with internet standards, we may also share certain information (including your IP address
			and the identification of content you wish to access) with our third party network providers that
			provide content delivery network services and game server services in connection with us. Our content
			delivery network providers enable the delivery of digital content you have requested, e.g. 
			by using a system of distributed servers that deliver the content to you, based on your geographic location.
			<br />
			<br />

			5.4 We may allow you to link your User Account to an account offered by a third party. If you
			consent to link the accounts, we may collect and combine information you allowed us to receive from a
			third party with information of your User Account to the degree allowed by your consent at the time.
			If the linking of the accounts requires the transmission of information about your person from us to a
			third party, you will be informed about it before the linking takes place and you will be given the
			opportunity to consent to the linking and the transmission of your information. The third party's use of
			your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy, which we encourage you to
			review.<br />
			<br />

			5.5 We may release Personal Data to comply with court orders or laws and regulations that require us to
			disclose such information. <br />
			<br />

			<b>6. Your Rights and Control Mechanisms</b><br />
			<br />

			The data protection laws of the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, California, and other territories
			grant their residents certain rights in relation to their Personal Data. While other jurisdictions may
			provide fewer statutory rights.(When we talk about the GDPR in this section, we mean the version of the GDPR that applies to you in the EU or UK).<br />
			<br />

			To allow you to exercise your data protection rights in a simple way we are providing a settings menu in our products. This gives you access to your Personal Data, allows you to
			rectify and delete it where necessary and to object to its use where you feel necessary. In most cases, you can
			access, manage, or delete Personal Data in the settings menu, but you may also contact us with
			questions or requests via the contact processes described in sections 8 and 10 below.<br />
			<br />

			As a resident of the European Economic Area or United Kingdom you have the following rights in relation to
			your Personal Data: <br />
			<br />

			6.1 Right of Access. <br />

			You have the right to access your Personal Data that we hold about you, i.e. the right to require free of
			charge (i) information whether your Personal Data is retained, (ii) access to and/or (iii) duplicates of the
			Personal Data retained. You can use the right to access to your Personal Data through the settings menu.
			If the request affects the rights and freedoms of others or is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve
			the right to charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the
			information or communication or taking the action requested) or refuse to act on the request. <br />
			<br />

			6.2 Right to Rectification. <br />
			If we process your Personal Data, we shall endeavor to ensure by implementing suitable measures that your
			Personal Data is accurate and up-to-date for the purposes for which it was collected. If your Personal Data
			is inaccurate or incomplete, you can change the information you provided via the settings menu.<br />
			<br />

			6.3. Right to Erasure. <br />
			You have the right to obtain deletion of Personal Data concerning you if the reason why we could collect it
			(see section 2. above) does not exist anymore or if there is another legal ground for its deletion. For
			individual items of Personal Data please edit them through the settings menu or request the deletion via
			 our support. You can also request the deletion of your user account via our support.<br />
			<br />

			As a result of deleting your User Account, you will lose access to our services, including the User Account, Subscriptions and game-related information linked to the User Account and the
			possibility to access other services you are using the User Account for. <br />
			<br />

			We allow you to restore your User Account during a grace period of 30 (thirty) days from the moment
			you request deletion of your User Account. This functionality allows you not to lose your account by
			mistake, because of your loss of your account credentials or due to hacking. During the suspension period,
			we will be able to finalize financial and other activities that you may have initiated before sending the
			User Account deletion request. After the grace period, Personal Data associated with your account will
			be deleted subject to section 4. above. <br />
			<br />

			In some cases, deletion of your User Account, and therefore Personal Data deletion, is complicated.
			Namely, if your account has a business relationship with us, you will only be able to delete your User Account after you have transferred this role to
			another user or have dissolved the business relationship. In some cases, considering the complexity and
			number of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended, but for no longer than two
			further months.<br />
			<br />

			6.4 Right to Object. <br />

			When our processing of your Personal Data is based on legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of
			the GDPR / section 2.c) of this Privacy Policy, you have the right to object to this processing. If you
			object we will no longer process your Personal Data unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate
			grounds for the processing as described in Article 21 of the GDPR; in particular if the data is necessary
			for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. You also have the right to lodge a complaint at
			a supervisory authority.<br />
			<br />

			6.5 Right to restriction of processing of your Personal Data<br />

			You have the right to obtain restriction of processing of your Personal Data under the conditions set out in
			article 18 of the GDPR.<br />
			<br />

			6.6 Right to Personal Data portability<br />

			You have the right to receive your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format
			and have the right to transmit those data to another controller under the conditions set out in article 20
			of the GDPR. <br />
			<br />

			6.7 Right to Post-Mortem Control of Your Personal Data<br />

			If French data protection legislation is applicable to you, you have the right to establish guidelines for
			the preservation, the deletion and the transmission of Personal Data after your death in accordance with
			article 40-1 of the Act No 78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Information, Technology, Data Files and Civil
			Liberties.<br />
			<br />

			<b>7. Children</b><br />
			<br />

			The minimum age to create a User Account is 13. We will not knowingly collect Personal Data from
			children under this age. Where certain countries apply a higher age of consent for the collection of
			Personal Data, we requires parental consent before a User Account can be created and Personal Data
			associated with it collected. We encourages parents to instruct their children to never give out personal
			information when online. <br />
			<br />

			<b>8. Contact Info</b><br />
			<br />

			You can contact us at support@nullstudio.cn, or our officer at the address below. <br />

			<b>9. Additional Information for Users from the European Economic Area, U.K., and Switzerland</b><br />
			<br />

			We may transfer and store your personal information outside the European Economic Area or United Kingdom, in
			countries which may not have equivalent data protection law. If we do so, we will take steps to ensure your
			personal information is protected by appropriate legal safeguards, like EU or UK standard contractual
			clauses, and that it is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. <br />
			<br />
			
			We and our wholly-owned subsidiaries
			(collectively we) comply with the EU and Swiss Privacy Shield Principles with respect to any Personal
			Data transferred from the EU, UK, and Switzerland to us in reliance on the Privacy Shield. If
			there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the
			Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov">https://www.privacyshield.gov</a>.<br />
			<br />

			The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over our compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles.
			Under the Principles, we shall remain liable if third party agents process the personal information on
			our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless we proves it is not responsible for the
			event giving rise to the damage. EU, UK and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our
			compliance with the Principles should first contact us here.
			As explained in the Privacy Shield documentation (<a
				href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction">https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction</a>)
			certain residual claims not resolved by other means may be subject to binding arbitration. If we do not address your concern satisfactorily, you can contact a third-party dispute resolution provider for an
			arbitration.<br />
			<br />

			<b>10. Additional Information for Users from California</b><br />
			<br />

			The CCPA grants California residents certain privacy rights regarding the Personal Data we collect. We are
			committed to respecting these rights and complying with the CCPA. The following explains these rights and
			our practices with respect to them. <br />
			<br />

			<b>Right to Know.</b> Under the CCPA you have the right to request that we disclose to you what Personal
			Data we collect, use, disclose, and sell. <br />
			<br />

			<b>Right to Request Deletion.</b> You also have the right to request deletion of Personal Data that is in
			our possession, subject to certain exceptions. Please note that your request to delete data may impact your
			use of our services in some cases, and we may decline to delete information for reasons set forth in
			this Privacy Policy or as permitted by the CCPA. <br />
			<br />

			<b>Other Rights.</b> The CCPA also gives California residents a right to opt-out from the sale of their
			Personal Data. As described in section 5, we do not sell Personal Data and have not done so in the past 12
			months. You also have a right to receive notice of our practices at or before collection of your Personal
			Data. Finally, you have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising your rights under the
			CCPA.<br />
			<br />

			<b>Exercising Your Rights.</b> The primary means of accessing, managing or deleting your Personal Data is
			through the settings menu in our products, as described in section 6 of this Policy. Customers may also delete their
			User Account and associated Personal Data as described in section 6.3 of this Privacy Policy. If you are
			unable to access or delete data through the settings menu, you can also contact us with a request to
			exercise these rights at the address described in section 8 of this Privacy Policy.
			Finally, you
			can contact us with a request at support@nullstudio.cn, however, before providing access to, or
			deleting any, Personal Data, based on a request received via email, we will need to verify your identity.
			<br />
			<br />

			You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your
			behalf to exercise your rights under the CCPA. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will
			require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to
			verify your identity directly with us. <br />
			<br />

			<b>Categories, Sources, Purposes, and Recipients of the Data We Collect.</b> Over the preceding 12 months,
			we have collected the categories of Personal Data described in section 3 of this Privacy Policy. The sources
			from which we collect Personal Data, and the purposes for which we collect and process it, are described in
			sections 2 and 3. Over the preceding 12 months, we have disclosed for business purposes each of the
			categories of Personal Data with the categories of third parties as described in section 5. <br />
